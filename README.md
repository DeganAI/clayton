## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

> **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required.

### Use the Starter (Recommended for Agent Creation)

Full steps and documentation can be found in the [Eliza Starter Repository](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza-starter).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza-starter.git
cd eliza-starter
cp .env.example .env
pnpm i && pnpm build && pnpm start
```

### Manually Start Eliza (Only recommended for plugin or platform development)

#### Checkout the latest release

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git

# This project iterates fast, so we recommend checking out the latest release
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
# If the above doesn't checkout the latest release, this should work:
# git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)
```

If you would like the sample character files too, then run this:
```bash
# Download characters submodule from the character repos
git submodule update --init
```

#### Edit the .env file

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the appropriate values.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: .env is optional. If you're planning to run multiple distinct agents, you can pass secrets through the character JSON

#### Start Eliza

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm start

# The project iterates fast, sometimes you need to clean the project if you are coming back to the project
pnpm clean
```

### Interact via Browser

Once the agent is running, you should see the message to run "pnpm start:client" at the end.

Open another terminal, move to the same directory, run the command below, then follow the URL to chat with your agent.

```bash
pnpm start:client
```

Then read the [Documentation](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/) to learn how to customize your Eliza.

---

### Automatically Start Eliza

The start script provides an automated way to set up and run Eliza:

```bash
sh scripts/start.sh
```

For detailed instructions on using the start script, including character management and troubleshooting, see our [Start Script Guide](./docs/docs/guides/start-script.md).

> **Note**: The start script handles all dependencies, environment setup, and character management automatically.

---

### Modify Character

1. Open `packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` to modify the default character. Uncomment and edit.

2. To load custom characters:
    - Use `pnpm start --characters="path/to/your/character.json"`
    - Multiple character files can be loaded simultaneously
3. Connect with X (Twitter)
    - change `"clients": []` to `"clients": ["twitter"]` in the character file to connect with X

---

### Add more plugins

1. run `npx elizaos plugins list` to get a list of available plugins or visit https://elizaos.github.io/registry/

2. run `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/plugin-NAME` to install the plugin into your instance

#### Additional Requirements

You may need to install Sharp. If you see an error when starting up, try installing it with the following command:

```
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
```

---

## Using Your Custom Plugins
Plugins that are not in the official registry for ElizaOS can be used as well. Here's how:

### Installation

1. Upload the custom plugin to the packages folder:

```
packages/
├─plugin-example/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts        # Main plugin entry
│   ├── actions/        # Custom actions
│   ├── providers/      # Data providers
│   ├── types.ts        # Type definitions
│   └── environment.ts  # Configuration
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

2. Add the custom plugin to your project's dependencies in the agent's package.json:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@elizaos/plugin-example": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

3. Import the custom plugin to your agent's character.json

```json
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-example",
  ],
```
